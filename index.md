# Hello World
 
This is my home page! My name is Bryan Alvarez and I am a student at Cal State Fullerton and my major is undecided.

### CPSC 120
 
*Lab 04
 
  Lab 04 was my 3rd favorite because I was wondering how we can implement math into coding and it was rather fascinating. We worked on Data Difference as 	   we had to convert a given date to a Julian Day and find the difference between the two days to know the numbers between them. It was quite the workout 	   for both me and my partner.
 
 *Lab 02
 
  Lab 02 was probably my second favorite lab because this was our first time starting a lab officially doing computer science. We were able to get familiar   with the git repository from GitHub and be able to understand how it functions. Our first lab consisted of Fahrenheit to Celsius, Quadratic Formula, and   hello.cc again.
 
 *Lab 06
 
  Finally Lab 06 was probably my favorite lab because we were able to make a guessing game, which was really fun. The guessing game is simple, where the 	   player must be able to guess the secret number between 1-100. This is where we practiced with while or do-while loops where the condition is always true,   which was fun to say the least.
